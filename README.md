# Fil Toolkit's Engine
A set of public packages used by the back-end and front-end FT instances.

These packages contain the necessary utilities for managing Editor's associated data. We start with our `three` package which targets utilities for parsing standard scenes, materials and texture libraries created from our Scene Editor. These utilities are built on top of [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/).

The packages are written in TypeScript.

These packages work on top of fil toolkit's infrastructure. They might result completely useless if not vinculated to FT back-end. Our editor is currently private and only available to our clients.

fil is the Catalan word for thread. We love threads cause we often talk about them when building applications and, at the same time, threads are something so organic, colourful and playful.
