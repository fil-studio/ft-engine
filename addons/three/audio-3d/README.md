[fil](https://fil.studio) is a studio with a creative tech soul. We build bespoke interactive journeys primarily using modern web technologies. We deliver tailored solutions for installations and on-line experiences using our internal toolkit + [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org).

fil is the Catalan word for thread. We love threads cause we often talk about them when building applications and, at the same time, threads are something so organic, colourful and playful.
